1. Developing a clear visualization representation of patent admission, treatment and discharge processed in EDs. 
2. Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in patient care workflows. 
Provide any actionable insights to improve ED efficiency and patient care quality. 
By demostrating the power of data visualization in heathcare management.
